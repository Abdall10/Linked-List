What is a Linked List in C++?
A linked list is a dynamic data structure in which elements (called nodes) are connected via pointers. Each node contains:

Data: The actual value or information stored in the node.
Pointer: A reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.
Unlike arrays, linked lists do not have a fixed size. They grow or shrink dynamically as needed, making them useful for situations where the size of the data structure is not known in advance.

Key Characteristics of a Linked List
Dynamic Memory Allocation: Nodes are created in the heap during runtime.
Efficient Insertion/Deletion: Adding or removing nodes doesn't require shifting other elements.
Sequential Access: You need to traverse the list to access elements.
Types of Linked Lists
Singly Linked List: Each node points to the next node.
Doubly Linked List: Each node points to both the next and the previous nodes.
Circular Linked List: The last node points back to the first node.
Components of a Singly Linked List in C++
Here is a simple implementation of a singly linked list:

Structure of a Node
cpp

struct Node {
    int data;       // Data stored in the node
    Node* next;     // Pointer to the next node
};
Basic Operations
Insertion: Add a new node to the linked list.
Traversal: Go through each node to access or display the data.
Deletion: Remove a node from the linked list.
Implementation of a Singly Linked List in C++
Here’s a simple example with all basic operations:

cpp

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Node structure
struct Node {
    int data;       // Data part
    Node* next;     // Pointer part
};

// Head pointer (global)
Node* head = NULL;

// Function to insert a node at the end of the list
void insertNode(int value) {
    Node* newNode = new Node; // Create a new node
    newNode->data = value;    // Set the data
    newNode->next = NULL;     // Set the pointer to NULL

    if (head == NULL) { // If the list is empty
        head = newNode;
    } else {
        Node* lastNode = head;
        while (lastNode->next != NULL) { // Traverse to the last node
            lastNode = lastNode->next;
        }
        lastNode->next = newNode; // Link the new node
    }
}

// Function to display the list
void displayList() {
    Node* current = head;
    if (head == NULL) {
        cout << "The list is empty." << endl;
        return;
    }
    while (current != NULL) {
        cout << current->data << " ";
        current = current->next;
    }
    cout << endl;
}

// Function to delete a node by value
void deleteNode(int value) {
    Node* current = head;
    Node* previous = NULL;

    if (current != NULL && current->data == value) { // If the head node is to be deleted
        head = current->next;
        delete current;
        return;
    }

    while (current != NULL && current->data != value) { // Find the node to delete
        previous = current;
        current = current->next;
    }

    if (current == NULL) {
        cout << "Value not found in the list." << endl;
        return;
    }

    previous->next = current->next; // Bypass the node to be deleted
    delete current;
}

int main() {
    insertNode(10);
    insertNode(20);
    insertNode(30);
    cout << "Linked List: ";
    displayList();

    deleteNode(20);
    cout << "After deleting 20: ";
    displayList();

    return 0;
}
Explanation of the Code
Insertion:

Create a new node using dynamic memory allocation.
Traverse to the end of the list and link the new node.
Display:

Start from the head and traverse the list, printing the data of each node.
Deletion:

Handle three cases:
The node to delete is the head.
The node is somewhere in the middle or end.
The node doesn’t exist.
Advantages of Linked Lists
Dynamic size.
Efficient insertion/deletion compared to arrays.
Disadvantages
Sequential access (no random access like arrays).
Extra memory for storing pointers.
Linked lists are fundamental in data structures and often serve as a building block for more advanced data structures like stacks, queues, and graphs.
